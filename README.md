## Project Description
The program draws multiple lines on screen simulating a piano, with a hand tracker using _MediaPipe_, we detected our fingers, then we can positioned our fingers in the keys drawed and play specifics notes or some chords.
I'm an amateur musician who loves piano, I thought it could be entertained code a simple piano using _MediaPipe_ and _OpenCV_.

I have several problems with sounds, but finally, with _pygame_, I was able to combine multiple sounds into one. In each frame, we detect the sounds that could be sound and add to an empty _.wav_ file, and finally after iteraing into each finger, we play the final sound.

The file could be edited to switch from your webcam to your phone's camera, using _IP Webcam_, only uncomments a few lines and that is all.

### Libraries, how to Install and Run
Maybe you will have to install multiple libraries, only copy this lines:
| Libraries | Links |
| ------ | ------ |
| [OpenCV][opencv] | ```pip install opencv-python``` |
| [MediaPipe][mediapipe] | ```pip install mediapipe``` |
| [PyGame][pygame]| ```pip install pygame``` |
| [Pydub][pydub]| ```pip install pydub``` |
| [Request][request] | ```pip install requests```|
| [Numpy][numpy] | ```pip install numpy``` |
| [imutils][imutils] | ```pip install imutils```|

If you already have all libraries, just drop the folder into VSCode and run!
> Note: This project was development with Python 3.10.2

## How to Use 
When you run the file, Python will draw lines in your video, so, try to position your webcam in a clear place and put your hand in front the webcam. When MediaPipe already detects your hands just keep your fingers in the keys and play. 

## Credits
I learned about hand tracker from a video. I will leave you the link [`Gesture Volumen Control`][videoTracker].
